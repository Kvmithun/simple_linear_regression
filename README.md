# simple_linear_regression
This notebook demonstrates the complete workflow of building a Simple Linear Regression model using Python to predict a student’s placement package based on CGPA. The project includes installing and importing essential libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn, loading the placement dataset using Pandas, and performing basic data inspection to understand the feature (CGPA) and target variable (package). The relationship between CGPA and placement package is visualized using a scatter plot, after which the data is prepared by separating independent and dependent variables and splitting it into training and testing sets. A Simple Linear Regression model is then built using LinearRegression, trained on the training data, and used to make predictions on the test data. The best-fit regression line is visualized, and the model is evaluated using standard performance metrics including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² score. Through this project, I gained a clear understanding of how linear regression works in practice, how to move from raw data to model evaluation, why data splitting and evaluation metrics are important, and how a simple machine learning model can be applied to a real-world academic dataset.
