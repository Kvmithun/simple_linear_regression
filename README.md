# simple_linear_regression
# This notebook presents a complete end-to-end implementation of Simple and Multiple Linear Regression using Python, with both models built from scratch through custom regression classes to avoid treating machine learning as a black box. The work includes importing essential libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn, loading and inspecting academic datasets, and performing basic exploratory data analysis to understand relationships between features and target variables. For Simple Linear Regression, the relationship between a single independent variable and the target variable is visualized using scatter plots, while Multiple Linear Regression analyzes the combined effect of multiple input features. In both cases, the data is prepared by separating independent and dependent variables and splitting it into training and testing sets to ensure unbiased evaluation.
# Custom Python classes are implemented for both regression models to handle coefficient calculation, model fitting, and prediction logic, providing a clear understanding of the underlying mathematical principles of linear regression. The trained models are evaluated on unseen test data using standard regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² score, and results are interpreted through visualizations and coefficient analysis to understand feature impact. Through this project, I gained practical insight into how regression models work internally, how to build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline from raw data to evaluation, and how simple and multiple linear regression techniques can be applied to real-world academic datasets using both theoretical understanding and practical implementation.
